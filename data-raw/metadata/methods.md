## Trap equipment
* A single 8-foot diameter rotary screw trap (RST)
* Diversion screen trap (DST)

## Current trap location
* Parrot-Phelan Diversion Dam on Butte Creek near Chico, California.

## Monitoring schedule
* October through June
* Continuously trapping except under high flows and unsafe working conditions
* Serviced daily within a 24-hour period, more if needed due to high debris amounts or fish catch

## Daily environmental data
* Water temperature (Celsius)
* Flow (cubic feet per second)

## Fish measurements
* Chinook salmon: 50 randomly selected
* Steelhead: first 10

Fork length measurements are taken to the nearest mm.


## Fish counts
* All fish not measured are plus counted by hand
* If juvenile Chinook salmon are highly abundant, a simple weight count method is used to count fish in increments of 500-1,000 or more to speed up processing.

## Trap efficiency trials
* Natural origin juvenile Chinook salmon captured in the RST and DST are the source of released fish.
* Frequency of once per week from December to May across variable flow and environmental conditions as catch totals allow. 
* A minimum of three consecutive days of fishing after the release date is required for a release to be included in analyses.
* Mortality between the release point and the trap is assumed to be negligible.  
* Release site located approximately 1 mile upstream of the trapping site.

## Trap efficiency mark
* Fish are marked with Bismarck Brown Y (BBY) whole body stain.
