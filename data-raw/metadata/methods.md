## Trap equipment

The traps used were an 8-foot Rotary Screw Trap (RST) and a Diversion Screen Trap (DST).

## Current trap location

The current trap location is at the Parrott-Phelan Diversion Dam (Butte Creek near Chico).

## Monitoring schedule

October-June
Continuously trapping except under high flows and unsafe working conditions, and traps were serviced daily within a 24-hour period, more if needed due to high debris amounts or fish catch.

## Daily environmental data

Daily environmental data collected were water temperature (Celsius) and flow (Cubic Feet per Second).

## Fish measurements

Fork length measurements to nearest mm taken for Chinook (50 randomly selected), Steelhead (first 10), and non-salmonids (first 10; total length).

## Fish counts

All fish not measured are plus counted by hand. If juvenile salmon are highly abundant, a simple weight count method is used to count Chinook in increments of 500-1,000 or more to speed up processing.

## Trap efficiency trials

Natural origin Chinook captured in RST and DST are the source of released fish. Trap efficiency trials were conducted once weekly December-May across variable flow and environmental conditions as catch totals allow. A minimum of 3 consecutive days of fishing after the release date is required for a release to be included in analysis. Mortality between the release point and the trap is assumed to be negligible. Release site approximately 1 mile upstream of trapping site.

## Trap efficiency mark

Fish are marked with Bismarck brown Y (BBY) whole body stain.
