## Trap equipment 

The traps used are an 8-foot Rotary Screw Trap (RST) and a Diversion Screen Trap (DST).

## Current trap location
The current trap location is at the Parrot-Phelan Diversion Dam on Butte Creek near Chico, California.

## Monitoring schedule
Continuously trapping October through June except under high flows and unsafe working conditions. Traps are serviced daily within a 24-hour period, more if needed due to high debris amounts or fish catch.

## Daily environmental data
Daily environmental data collected are water temperature (Celsius) and flow (cubic feet per second).

## Fish measurements
Fork length measurements are taken to the nearest mm for 50 randomly selected Chinook salmon and the first 10 Steelhead.

## Fish counts
All fish not measured are plus counted by hand. If juvenile salmon are highly abundant, a simple weight count method is used to count Chinook in increments of 500-1,000 or more to speed up processing.

## Trap efficiency trials
Natural origin Chinook captured in RST and DST are the source of released fish. Trap efficiency trials are conducted once per week from December to May across variable flow and environmental conditions as catch totals allow.  A minimum of three consecutive days of fishing after the release date is required for a release to be included in analysis. Mortality between the release point and the trap is assumed to be negligible. Release site is located approximately 1 mile upstream of the trapping site.

## Trap efficiency mark
Fish are marked with Bismarck Brown Y (BBY) whole body stain.
